# Editor's Note

My name is Tyler Jensen. I'm the creator of The Ioka Project. I started my career as a technical writer and later became a programmer. While I have had many job titles, my work has always involved writing and editing English and code. On most days I find writing for the machine easier than writing for a human audience. With the emergence of generative AI, I became fascinated with it and began writing code to use it. This is the result of one of those projects.

## The Ioka Project

The Ioka (EYE-oh-ka) Project is an exploration in long-form, non-fiction generative AI. I want to share the results of this project in an open way that allows readers, including critics, to provide feedback and see the evolution of each edition. 

This is a crowd funded project, accepting donations and selling properly formatted copies of the books produced by the project on LeanPub. Your support is welcome and appreciated. Your feedback is also welcome.

With the exception of this Editor's Note, all content is generated unless otherwise noted in the text. As the Ioka Project evolves, I will be exploring ways that generated content may be validated and improved through a combination of conventional search retrieval and generative AI content analysis.

## Copyrights

Tyler Jensen is the legal copyright holder of this work. Publication of this work without permission is prohibited by copyright law. I recognize there is an ongoing debate about copyright and AI. I have no intention of using this project to enter that debate, but if you have written material that the generated text infringes and you provide me with links and a request, I will immediately remedy any infringement and document that case here.

## Notes on Current Edition

This is the first public edition of this book. It has gone through several iterations prior to this publication as I've tweaked and experimented with the code that does the work. This includes code to remove odd artifacts that can creep into the results of generative AI, but no alteration of the content produced by the AI has been undertaken in the code.
